The repo contains four files 
tcam_ex.c , list_api.c , list_api.h and a makefile

Actual API implenetaion is in tcam_ex.c files 
List_api.c and list_api.h are library files which contains list API's which I used in building tcam_insert and tcam_remove functions

  >>>>>> To build <<<<<<<
   make
 
the above makefile build a tcam exe 

  >>> to execute <<<<<<<
  ./tcam  


Assumptions :
  I assumed that IDs are Unique and monotonically increasing in the batch ,
  added a commnet in the code on how to handle the case if the ID's are not   unique

Design Considerations :
 Mmaintaining a linked list , which keeps track of free entries which we can use  for inserting entries which satisfies priority vs location rules . This  will give the free index in constant time and better performance compared to sorting the elements
